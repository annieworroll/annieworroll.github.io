## Self Assessment

Throughout the Computer Science program, I have improved my skills in several
ways and identified some areas I am better or worse at. 

## Collaboration

There was not much collaboration in this program. A few projects were structured
as if they were my share of an overall project, but nothing that involved actual
work with other people. However, for that, I can look back at a project at another
school. At Gateway Community College in New Haven, CT, I took two semesters of 
COBOL. The final project was a group project, I don't recall the details but we
each took a different part of the project, agreed on interfaces between each of
our components so that we could get a project done of significantly greater scope
than we could have done on our own.

And while informal, for the database component of the project I worked on for 
this course, I had a bug where reading from the database caused an infinite loop
of writes to the database. Speaking with coworkers about it, since they don't 
have more than the basic computer literacy that most in the US have, I had to 
break it down in a simple manner. This light collaboration on debugging helped 
me identify the problem almost immediately and find a way to fix it. 

## Communicating with stakeholders

Several projects were presented as communications from stakeholders. The UI/UX
course also included some interview work with potential users of the application.
This sharpened my skills and gave me some experience with this topic. Several 
courses also included preparing various design documents such as state diagrams
and class diagrams in UML, to give a stakeholder a formalized and precise way to
see how the project was turning out, without committing to a significant coding 
effort which might be much harder to roll back if a problem is discovered.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Several courses covered various data structures and algorithms, but Software Testing
and Quality Assurance was of particular note here. While the original work in that 
course was little more than an excuse to show off some unit testing tools, when 
updating it for the capstone I was forced to confront the data structure choice and
spend time reading documentation and considering the pros and cons of each.

## Software Engineering and Database

The full stack development course was particularly good here. It ensured strict
seperation of different components and interaction with a database. 

## Artifacts

The artifact I worked with is the Contact Service from CS320 Software Testing and 
Quality Assurance. This was a pair of Java classes for a contact manager application.
This is a useful application category, so much so that it is integrated into email
clients. I saw an opportunity to improve its utility on limited systems by porting it
to C++, to improve flexibility in how it is worked with by changing the data structure,
and this is a very natural fit for a database for persistent storage.
